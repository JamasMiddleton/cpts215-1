It’s fairly easy to answer 2, 3, and 4, respectively, and we can quickly convince ourselves that, in general, $10^n$ is 1 followed by n zeros and, thus, $10^n$ has n + 1 digits. But what about $3^100$? How many digits are there in $3^100? In this task, you’ll write a program that will answer this question.\n",

    "* `main()`: Prompts for the base j and exponent k and displays the results of the calculations.\n",
