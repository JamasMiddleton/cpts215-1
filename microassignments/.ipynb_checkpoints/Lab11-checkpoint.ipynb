    "With tuples, we can return multiple values from a function by simply packing them in a tuple. This task demonstrates returning multiple values from a single function by returning a two-item tuple.\n",

    "Write a program to model a simple calculator. The user enters an operand and a value they want to calculate based on the accumulated result. Assume the left operand is the accumulator value (initially zero). \n",

    "You need a function `scan_data()` that returns the operator and right operand scanned in from the user as a `tuple`. You need a function `do_next_op()` that performs the required operation. `do_next_op()` has three input parameters, the operator, the operand, and the accumulator. `do_next_op()` returns the updated accumulator value.\n",

    "Write a program to generate files containing words represented by [ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art).

For example, the key \"A\" maps to the string represented by the entire contents of A.txt (think `<file object>.read()`).
