    "Write a hangman program (hangperson.py to be politically correct). If you are not familiar with the game, read about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)). The game is played as follows:\n",
    "1. Program selects a word for the user to guess.\n",
    "1. User guesses one letter at a time until either they guess the word, or they run out of guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Program Details\n",
    "1. Select a random word for the user to guess from a file. The file can contain a variable number of words, one per line (at least 10 words in the file).\n",
    "    1. Read the words into a list\n",
    "    1. Use `random.randrange(<start_index>, <end_index + 1>)` to select a random `word` in the list\n",
    "1. Maintain 2 lists:\n",
    "    1. `available_letters`: a list of the available letters the user can choose their guess from. Initialize `available_letters` as the lowercase alphabet. As the user guesses letters, remove the corresponding guessed letter to denote the letter has already been guessed.\n",
    "    1. `visible_letters`: a list of the not guessed letter in `word`. Initialize `visible_letters` to all dashes (\"-\"). As the user correctly guesses a letter, replace the corresponding dash(es) with the correct letter.\n",
    "1. Enter the main game loop:\n",
    "    1. Display information regarding the status of the game (string representing `visible_letters`, string representing `available_letters`, and the number of incorrect guesses remaining (the user gets 7 incorrect guesses).\n",
    "    1. Prompt user to enter their guess. If they have already guessed a letter, let the user know.\n",
    "    1. Exit the loop if they completely guess the letters of the word or they run out of incorrect guesses.\n",
    "Use functions!! You will be graded based on your organization of code. Remember, one task = one algorithm = one function."
