    "1. Tic Tac Toe (see Option 1: Tic Tac Toe section below)\n",

    "#### Option 1: Tic Tac Toe\n",
    "Write a program (tictactoe.py) for two-player interactive game to play [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe). The Tic Tac Toe game board consists of a total of `n` x `n` cells, where `n` is selected by the user of the game. Your program should randomly select who goes first, X or O. Once a player has been chosen, your program should prompt the player for a position (row and column) in which to draw his/her symbol. Players continue to alternate moves until either a winner has been determined or a \"scratch\" game occurs. A player wins if his/her symbols align with `n` in a row diagonally, vertically, or horizontally. A \"scratch\" game occurs if all cells on the board are occupied and no player aligned `n` of his/her symbols in a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Program Details\n",
    "The underlying game board should be represented with the following structures:\n",
    "1. `Coordinate`: representing the coordinates of a cell on the board. `Coordinate` should contain the following attributes and methods (at a minimum):\n",
    "    1. `row`: a row location\n",
    "    1. `col`: a column location\n",
    "    1. `__str__()`: returns a string representation of a `Coordinate`, i.e. (0, 0)\n",
    "1. `Cell`, representing a cell on the board. `Cell` should contain the following attributes (at a minimum):\n",
    "    1. `occupied`: whether or not this cell is occupied\n",
    "    1. `symbol`: the symbol to display at this cell (X for player one, O for the other player)\n",
    "    1. `location`: the location of this cell on the board (a `Coordinate` object).\n",
    "    1. `__str__()`: returns a string representation of a `Cell`, i.e. return the symbol\n",
    "1. `TicTacToeBoard`: representing the Tic Tac Toe board. `Board` should contain the following attributes and methods (at a minimum):\n",
    "    1. `n`: dimension of board (entered by user)\n",
    "    1. `board`: the Tic Tac Toe `n` x `n` grid (a 2-Dimensional list of `Cell` objects)\n",
    "    1. `__str__()`: returns a string representation of a `TicTacToeBoard`, i.e. display the game board\n",
    "    1. `is_valid_move()`: accepts the coordinates of a cell. Returns True if the coordinates are valid and the cell is unoccuppied; otherwise returns False.\n",
    "    1. `make_move()`: accepts the coordinates of a cell and a symbol. Marks the cell with the symbol.\n",
    "    1. `is_winner()`: accepts a player symbol (X or O). Returns True if there are `n` in a row of the player symbol; otherwise returns False\n",
    " \n",
    "The program should prompt the users to determine if they want to play another game. Keep track of each player's number of wins, losses, and total game played in a `GameStats` class. When the user wants to quit playing Tic Tac Toe games, report both of the user's game stats, including:\n",
    "* Win to loss ratio\n",
    "* Percentage of games won\n",
    "* Number of scratch games\n",
